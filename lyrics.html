<p>No one can code like Bruno, no, no, no!</p>
<p>No one can code like Bruno... but</p>

<p>It was my wedding page</p>
<p>It was our wedding page</p>
<p>We were getting ready, and there wasn't a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/">cloud</a> in the sky</p>
<p>No <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-cloud">clouds</a> allowed in the sky</p>

<p>Bruno walks in with a mischievous grin-</p>
<p>Thunder!!</p>
<p>You telling this story, or am I?</p>
<p>I'm sorry, mi vida, go on</p>

<p>Bruno says, "the wifi's down"</p>
<p>Why did he tell us?</p>
<p>In doing so, he breaks my sound</p>
<p>Abuela, gets the <a href="https://translate.google.com/?sl=es&tl=en&text=papeles&op=translate">papeles</a></p>
<p>Routed by a <a href="http://he.net/">hurricane</a></p>
<p>What a joyous day... but anyway</p>

<p>No one can code like Bruno, no, no, no!</p>
<p>No one can code like Bruno</p>

<p>Hey! Grew to live in fear of Bruno <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet">stuttering or stumbling</a></p>
<p>I could always hear him sort of <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/mutter">muttering</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble">mumbling</a></p>
<p>I associate him with the sound of spinning fans, pfs-pfs-pfs</p>
<p>It's a heavy lift, with a gift so humbling</p>
<p>Always left Abuela and the family fumbling</p>
<p>Grappling with webpages they couldn't understand</p>
<p>Do you understand?</p>

<p>A seven pixel frame</p>
<p>rats along its back</p>
<p>when he calls your_name()</p>
<p>it all fades to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value#color_keywords">black</a></p>
<p>Yeah, he sees your screen</p>
<p>and turns it all GREEEEN (hey!)</p>

<p>No one can code like Bruno, no, no, no! (No one can code like Bruno, no, no, no!)</p>
<p>No one can code like Bruno (No one can code like Bruno)</p>

<p>He told me my job would die</p>
<p>the next night: dead! (No, no!)</p>
<p>He told me my mic's unplugged</p>
<p>And just like he said... (no, no!)</p>
<p>He said that all my tags would disappear, now look at my &lt;head&gt; (no, no! Hey!)</p>
<p>Your fate is sealed when the database is read!</p>

<p>He told me that the life of my dreams would be <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise">Promised</a>, and someday be mine</p>
<p>He told me that my flowers would grow, like the grapes that thrive on the vine</p>
<p>Óye, Mariano's on his way</p>

<p>He told me that the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/">man</a> of my dreams would be just out of reach</p>
<p>Obscured by another</p>
<p>It's like I hear him now</p>
<p>Hey <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/sysfs.5.html">/sys/</a>, I want not a <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/sound_system">sound</a> out of you (it's like I can hear him now)</p>
<p>I can hear him now</p>

<p>Um, Bruno...</p>
<p>Yeah, about that Bruno...</p>
<p>I really need to know about Bruno...</p>
<p>Gimmie the truth and the whole truth, Bruno</p>
<p>(Isabella, your boyfriend's here)</p>
<p>Time for <a href="https://hackuci.com">coding</a>!</p>

<p>A seven pixel frame (It was my wedding page, It was our wedding page)</p>
<p>rats along its back (we were getting ready)</p>
<p>when he calls your_name() (and there wasn't a cloud in the sky)</p>
<p>it all fades to black (no clouds allowed in the sky!)</p>
<p>Yeah, he sees your screen (Bruno walks in with a mischievous grin-)</p>
<p>and turns it all GREEEEN (thunder!)</p>
<p>You telling this story, or am I?</p>
<p>I'm sorry, mi vida, go on (óye, Mariano's on his way)</p>

<p>Bruno says, "the wifi's down" (A seven pixel frame, rats along its back)</p>
<p>In doing so, he breaks my sound</p>
<p>Routed by a hurricane</p>
<p>He's here!</p>

<p>Don't talk about Bruno, no! (Why did I talk about Bruno?)</p>
<p>Not a word about Bruno</p>
<p>I never should've brought up Bruno!</p>
